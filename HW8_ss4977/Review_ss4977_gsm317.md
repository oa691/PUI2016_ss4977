#Mayes Gregory Stevan's Plot Review

Mayes' plot defines clear ranges of values for age of boilers and fuel consumption per square foot. It is easy to see which scatterpoints and which slope accompanies each fuel type. The caption makes clear what is being presented and the source for the presented information. The axis labels are a good size and they clarify the units of measurement.<br>

A few items that could be improved. One, the plot is missing a title. Two, the text in the legend could be a few points larger. Three, it looks odd for the regression line for #6 oil to be so much shorter than the one for #4 oil. Even though the age range is narrower for such boilers, this could be shown with a dashed line past the maximum age to show that it is an extrapolation.
